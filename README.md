## ✨ Features

- Sentence-level semantic matching using transformer-based embeddings
- Computes similarity scores between resumes and job descriptions
- Ranks job matches for each resume
- Visualizes results using matplotlib/seaborn
- Works with custom datasets (CSV/text files)

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python 3.11+
- [Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- PyTorch (via Transformers backend)
